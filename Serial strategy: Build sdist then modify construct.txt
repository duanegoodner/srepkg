Serial strategy: Build sdist then modify construction_dir contents as needed to build wheel


Concurrent strategy:
- Build duplicate construction_dirs up to point where they need to diverge for sdist vs. wheel
- Define separate functions for remaining work for each type of distribution build, and then run these via threads or multiprocess
