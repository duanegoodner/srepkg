# srepkg (Solo Repackage)

Add a safeguard to a dependency-laden Python command line  interface (CLI) app to ensure users can only install it in an isolated virtual environment but can run it from outside that environment.

## Description

**srepkg** is a Python package that wraps an isolation layer around other Python packages. A package that has been "re-packaged" is referred to as an "S-package."

When an S-package is installed in an active, pre-existing Python environment, the original package plus its dependencies are installed in a new, automatically created virtual environment. A dependency-free "access" package installed in the pre-existing environment contains a controller module cabable of making calls to the Python interpreter in the newly created environment. This package structure prevents dependency conflicts but still exposes the original packageâ€™s CLI to the pre-existing environment. 

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python version 3.6 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#)
- To be compatible with srepkg, a package must:
  * Be installable via pip
  * Have command line entry point(s) specifiied in a setup.py or setup.cfg file.

### Installing srepkg

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/duanegoodner/srepkg
```

### Usage

```
usage: srepkg [-h] [-n [SREPKG_NAME]] [-c [CONSTRUCTION_DIR]] [-d [DIST_OUT_DIR]] orig_pkg_ref

positional arguments:
  orig_pkg_ref          A reference to the original package to be repackaged. Can be a local path to a directory
                        where a package's setup.py resides, a PyPI package name, or Github repo

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n [SREPKG_NAME], --srepkg_name [SREPKG_NAME]
                        Name to be used for repackaged package. Default is <ORIGINAL_PACKAGE_NAME + srepkg>
  -c [CONSTRUCTION_DIR], --construction_dir [CONSTRUCTION_DIR]
                        Directory where non-compressed repackage will be built and saved. If not specified, srepkg
                        is built in a temp directory and deleted after distribution archive creation
  -d [DIST_OUT_DIR], --dist_out_dir [DIST_OUT_DIR]
                        Directory where srepkg distribution .zip file is saved. Default is the current working
                        directory.
```

### Output

If the user-provided command just takes the form `$ srepkg orig_pkg_ref`  (i. e. no optional arguments are used), srepkg saves the re-packaged 'S-package' as a .zip file named `ORIGINAL_NAMEsrepkg-ORIGINAL_VERSION.zip` in the directory from which srepkg is called. ORIGINAL_NAME and ORIGINAL_VERSION are the respective name and version of the original package as specified in its setup.py or setup.cfg file.

### Installing an S-package

A distribution archive produced by srepkg can be installed using pip. If we are in the directory where we have used srepkg to create `ORIGINAL_NAMEsrepkg-ORIGINAL_VERSION.zip`, we can install it with the command:

```
$ pip install ORIGINAL_NAMEsrepkg-ORIGINAL_VERSION.zip
```

### Using an S-package

Once an S-package has been installed in a user's global Python environment, or (preferably) a virtual environment, all command line entry points of the original CLI application are available in that environment. The syntax of these commands is identical to that of the original application.

## Examples

#### 1. Repackaging a local package

The srepkg Github repo has a small example CLI package named testproj saved in `srepkg/src/test/package_test_cases/testproj/`. In testproj's setup.cfg file, we can see that it depends on non-standard library package numpy.

From the root of the srepkg repo, we can re-package testproj and save the S-package distribution archive to our home directory using:

```
$ srepkg src/srepkg/test/package_test_cases/testproj -d ~ 
```

When the re-packaging process is complete, we have the following output:

```
Repackaging testproj
Building source distribution of repackaged package
Original package 'testproj' has been re-packaged as 'testprojsrepkg'

The re-packaged version has been saved as source distribution archive file: /Users/duane/testprojsrepkg-0.0.0.zip
'testprojsrepkg' can be installed using:  pip install /Users/duane/testprojsrepkg-0.0.0.zip

After installation, 'testprojsrepkg' will provide command line access to the following commands:
my_test
```

Before proceeding, let's create and activate a new virtual environment so we can clearly see what package(s) do / don't get added to the environment when we install testprojsrepkg.

```
$ python -m venv my_venv
$ source my_venv/bin/activate
```

Now we are ready to install our S-package with pip:

```
(my_venv) $ pip install ~/testprojsrepkg-0.0.0.zip -q 
```

We can use pip freeze to confirm that howdoisrepkg is the only non-standard library package installed in the environment.

```
(my_venv) $ pip freeze
testprojsrepkg @ file:///Users/duane/testprojsrepkg-0.0.0.zip
```

Neither original package testproj nor its dependency numpy is installed in the active environment, but we can still access the testproj CLI in the same way we would if it were installed in the active environment

```
(my_venv) $ my_123_multiplier -h
usage: my_123_multiplier [-h] factor

Multiplies the numpy array [1 2 3] by a user-provided integer. Displays the resulting array as well as the version
of numpy used.

positional arguments:
  factor      An integer that numpy array [1 2 3] will be multiplied by

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

(my_venv) $ my_123_multiplier 2
2 * [1 2 3] = [2 4 6]
numpy version used by this program = 1.22.4
```

#### 2. Repackaging a PyPI package

An S-package can also be built by providing a PyPI package name as the package_reference argument. Here, we repackage the [PyPI package *howdoi*](https://pypi.org/project/howdoi/). Let's continue working in the virtual environment created in the previous example.

```
(my_venv) $ srepkg howdoi -d ~
Original package howdoi has been repackaged as howdoisrepkg
howdoisrepkg has been saved as source distribution /Users/duane/howdoisrepkg-2.0.19.zip
'howdoisrepkg' can be installed using: pip install /Users/duane/howdoisrepkg-2.0.19.zip
After installation, 'howdoisrepkg' will provide command line access to the following commands:
howdoi
```

We can then install the S-package, confirm that we have access to the original package's CLI, and run `pip freeze` to list the non-standard packages installed in the current environment.

```
(my_venv) $ pip install ~/howdoisrepkg-2.0.19.zip -q
(my_venv) $ howdoi redirect standard out
yourcommand &> filename
(my_venv) $ pip freeze
	testprojsrepkg @ file:///Users/duane/testprojsrepkg-0.0.0.zip
	howdoisrepkg @ file:///Users/duane/dproj/howdoisrepkg-2.0.19.zip
```

Note that *howdoi* has a number dependencies (Pygments, cssselect, lxml, pyquery, requests, cachelib, appdirs, keep, rich, and colorama), but none of these packages are installed in my_venv.

#### 3. Repackaging a package from a Github repo

When the package reference argument is a Github repository, it takes the same form that pip uses when installing a package from Github. Below are examples of how to build S-packages based on code from the [*howdoi* Github repository](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi).

## Comparing srepkg with a similar tool: [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)

srepkg is in many ways similar to the widely used tool [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) which also allows users to install a Python package in an isolated environment and then access its command line tool(s) from another environment. Key differences between srepkg and pipx include:

* The actions that ensure isolation via pipx are taken by the user at the time of package installation. With srepkg, source code is wrapped in an isolating layer prior to installation, and the re-packaged application is automatically placed in its own environment during installation. 
* The CLI of a srepkg S-package is only accessible from an environment containing its access package. pipx allows global access to isolated command line applications. 
* pipx is more mature and feature-rich than srepkg. If you have control of the package installation process, pipx will likely be more useful than srepkg. However, if you are distributing but not installing a Python CLI app and want to be certain the app is always installed into an isolated environment regardless what happens at install time, consider using srepkg.



## Roadmap

### Functionality

* Option to add prefix before CLI command. This would allow multiple re-packaged versions of the same original package to be accessed from single environment.
* Change behavior in cases where srepkg does not find console entry points or package name from from setup.cfg or setup.py. Instead of exiting, give re-packaging user the option to proceed and have inner_pkg_installer module look for these items during S-package install process.

### Performance

* Use [fastentrypoints](https://github.com/ninjaaron/fast-entry_points) to prevent delay that occurs the first time an S-package's CLI is accessed
* Reduce install time via .whl support for
