# Welcome to the ***srepkg*** Documentation Site

*srepkg* is a Python package that wraps an isolation layer around other Python packages.

## Description

When a package wrapped in an isolation layer by *srepkg* is installed in an active, pre-existing Python environment:

- The original package plus its dependencies are installed in a new, automatically created virtual environment.
- A dependency-free "access" package installed in the pre-existing environment contains a controller module capable of making calls to the Python interpreter in the newly created environment.
- This package structure ensures that none of the original package's dependencies conflict with packages in the pre-existing environment but still exposes the original package’s CL to the pre-existing environment. 

## Typical Use Cases

### For Package Distributors
- *srepkg* can be useful if you are sharing a Python command line application, and you want to be certain that users can install and run it without worrying about dependency conflicts. 
- Wrapping a CL package with *srepkg* prior to sharing the package with other users will ensure that wherever the package is installed, it does not introduce dependency conflicts into a user's existing Python environment &mdash; even if the user knows nothing about managing Python environments.

### For Package Users
- Any existing CL package obtained from Python Packaging Index (PyPI) or GitHub can be wrapped with *srepkg* prior to installation.
- If you want the original package commands to be accessible from a single environment (that is distinct from the isolated environment where the original package is installed), then *srepkg* is likely a good option.
- However, if you want the isolated package's command interface to be available globally and/or want a much more mature isolation tool, then [pipx]("https://github.com/pypa/pipx") is likely a better choice.
