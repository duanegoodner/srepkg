# Welcome to the srepkg documentation
*Add a safeguard to a dependency-laden Python command line  interface (CLI) app to ensure users can only install it in an isolated virtual environment but can run it from outside that environment.*

## Description

**srepkg** is a Python package that wraps an isolation layer around other Python packages. A package that has been "re-packaged" is referred to as an "S-package."

When an S-package is installed in an active, pre-existing Python environment, the original package plus its dependencies are installed in a new, automatically created virtual environment. A dependency-free "access" package installed in the pre-existing environment contains a controller module cabable of making calls to the Python interpreter in the newly created environment. This package structure prevents dependency conflicts but still exposes the original packageâ€™s CLI to the pre-existing environment. 



## Typical Use Case

srepkg can be useful if you are sharing a Python command line application, and you want to be certain that users can install and run it without worrying about dependency conflicts. You might be sharing application **X** that depends on package **Y** version 1.0, but users may want to run **X** from an environment where they require Y version 2.0. Or perhaps you just want to save users the trouble of dependency and/or environment management.
